Note: As the assignment brief was ambiguous regarding the presents, I have assumed the following
      format for my program

    PRESENTS 1          1 represents the ID of the hopper it belongs to (eg: hopper 1)
    2                   2 represents the number of presents
    4-10                4 is the min age, 10 is the max age
    5-13                5 is the min age, 13 is the max age

    PRESENTS 2          2 represents the ID of the hopper it belongs to (eg: hopper 2)
    1                   1 represents the number of presents
    4-10                4 is the min age, 10 is the max age

      While I believe this is correct, it might not be - thus I included this explanation
      of my interpretation in the test_file_descriptors document.
